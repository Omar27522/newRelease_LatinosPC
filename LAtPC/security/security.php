    <h1><a href="?security#navi" title="click here to select text">Pass-words managers for passwords:</a></h1><h3>password managers have inherited problems and risks in exchange for convenience to the user.</h3>
    <h2>These problems include:</h2><h3>Security breaches:</h3>Password managers store all of your passwords in a single location, so if a hacker gains access to the password manager's database, they will have access to all of your stored passwords.
    <h3>Loss of access:</h3>If you lose access to your password manager account (e.g. if you forget your master password), you will lose access to all of your stored passwords.
    <h3>Phishing:</h3>If a user falls for a phishing attack, the attacker may gain access to the user's password manager account, including all the stored passwords.
    <h3>Cloud-based password manager:</h3>If the password manager is cloud-based, the company that runs the service could potentially access your stored passwords, or they could be compromised in a data breach.
    <h3>Single point of failure:</h3>If the password manager software or service goes down or out of business, you may lose access to all of your stored passwords.To mitigate risks, your password manager should be set up with strong and unique master password, enabled multi-factor authentication (2FA) and regularly updated software. Additionally, it's important to backup the password manager's data to a safe place and keep an offline copy of your important passwords in a secure location.</div>

<h3>A backup is a copy of data that can be used to restore the original data in the event that it is lost or damaged. Backups are important because they allow you to recover from data loss due to accidents, hardware failures, software corruption, or other causes. There are many different approaches to backing up data, and the best approach will depend on your specific needs and resources.<br />

Some common types of backups include:<br /><br />

<span class="box2">Full backups:</span> These backups include a complete copy of all data. Full backups can be time-consuming to create and restore, but they provide a complete record of all data and are useful for disaster recovery.<br /><br />

<span class="box2">Incremental backups:</span> These backups only include changes made since the last backup. Incremental backups are faster to create and restore than full backups, but they may not provide as much protection in the event of a disaster.<br /><br />

<span class="box2">Differential backups:</span> These backups include all changes made since the last full backup. Differential backups are similar to incremental backups in that they only include changes, but they provide more protection than incremental backups because they include all changes made since the last full backup.<br />

<span class="box2">Mirror backups:</span> These backups create an exact copy of the data being backed up. Mirror backups are useful for quickly restoring data, but they may not be as comprehensive as other types of backups.<br /><br />

It is generally recommended to create backups on a regular basis and to store them in a secure location, such as an external hard drive or a cloud-based storage service. This will ensure that you have access to your data in case of an emergency.</h3>

<strong><a href="#onsite_b">Onsite</a></strong> backup is easy to set up, data is convenient to
access and no Internet connection is 
required to backup or restore data.</h3>
<h3>
<strong><a href="#offsite_b">Offsite</a></strong> backup is essentially saving the data on a memory drive or other device,
and taking the device to a different place away from the primary location.</h3>
<h3>
<strong><a href="#online_b">Cloud</a></strong> backup requires an Internet connection to access cloud space
where data is stored, it's simple, and data can be accessed from anywhere.</h3>

Storing data on a physical media, now days portable hard drives and flash drives are the most common ways to backup data.
say, you had 2 hard rives on your computer, one can be your main hard drive and the other can be your backup, if your hard drive were to fail,
then all there is to do is to restore the data onto a new hard drive from the backup. and this way the downtime you will experience will be minimum
the last example was a worst case scenario, hard drives are smart enough to tell the computer when they have errors and that they might fail.</h3>

Storing data on a physical media, now days portable hard drives and flash drives are the most common ways to backup data.
say, you had 2 hard drives on your computer, and the information is so important that one backup is not enough, because all of the data is in one place
there is a risk of losing the data and the backup at the same time, one can prevent this by taking the backup away from the building 
to make it more secure in case of a disaster that can take your main data with it. the advantage of the off-site backup is that one can
restore the data onto a new computer from the off-site backup. and this way the downtime you will experience will be minimum.
the last example was a worst case scenario, h-drives are smart enough to tell the computer when they have errors and that they might fail, and to keep in mind that a replacement drive will be needed.</h3>
<h2 id="online_b">Cloud storage &nbsp;</h2>
<div class="clr"></div><h3>
Storing data on the internet, that way if you were to need a file, you can simply log in and retrieve the file from your online backup account.
there are services that backup your data automatically online, most of the free ones have limited space and capabilities.</h3>

	authentication protocol,[4] the verifier is able to infer
	the claimant's identity. “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Traditional Advice tells us that a strong and secure
 password is 12 characters, minimum. Includes special
 characters, and a mix of lower and upper case letters.
 The password is not a dictionary word, or many. And
 doesn’t use obvious substitution, like a letter for a
 number or vice versa. </p>

 Is an added extra security
layer, that in simplest terms is two passwords (factors).
 The user is granted access by presenting the passwords

 the user only knows), possession(something the user has),
 and (who the user is) Inheritance is presented to the
 authentication mechanism.</p></li>

<h3>Passwords will have to be secured and should have a combination of alphanumeric numbers,
(a-z, 1-9) and other character symbols(!@#$%^&*{}|`). Also secure passwords should be at least
12 characters in length.<br /> </h3><p>#note; capitalized letters are recognized different from lowercase,
 a T is different from t.</p>

 <h2>Print the <a href="?perfect_paper_passwords#navi">PassCard:</a></h2>

 <p><strong>How to use the <a href="?perfect_paper_passwords#navi">pass card:</a> </strong>
By default the passcard generates a block of four characters (password piece)
A-G, 1-10. A strong secure password should be of at least 12 characters long.
Instead of memorizing a long password, is much simpler for a human to memorize a pattern.</p>

For this password, the sequence will be C3|G7|B10|E5|A1<br />
The second password's sequence, will be A7|C9|D3|F4<br />

“Almost without exception, today's Internet users prove
 their identity online using a fixed account name and password.
 In the past, this simple system provided sufficient security.
 But with the growing popularity of online banking and eCommerce,
 the value of stealing online identities has skyrocketed. And the
 increasing presence and "spyware" and "malware" on innocent users'
 computers means that users can be "watched" while logging onto their
 banking and other eCommerce sites. Once their logon credentials have
 been "captured" and stolen, Internet criminals can easily assume their identity.
The trouble with a username and password is that they never change.
 We create them, write them down or memorize them, then use them over
 and over again. What has been needed is an inexpensive system that
 provides something which changes everytime it is used. GRC's Perfect
 Paper Passwords system offers a simple, safe and secure, free and well
 documented solution that is being adopted by a growing number of
 security-conscious Internet facilities to provide their users with
 state-of-the-art cryptographic logon security.” <a href="https://grc.com/ppp.htm">https://grc.com/</a><br />

<p>Sequence Key: Every-time the page refreshes the sequence key changes. You can copy and paste your key to later reprint the same card .
</p><br />
<p>Passcode character set: 64, 88, or your own. The alphabet that your password will have is the passcode character set. The default option offers 64 conservative characters, the second option however is much more visually aggressive, and therefore much more secure.
</p><br />
<p>Passcode length: The length of the block in characters; the minimum is two the maximum is sixteen.
</p><br />
<p>Passcard label:The name of your passcard, e.g. email,Social media, entertainment,Work etc.
</p><br />
<p>First passcard to generate: by default the fist passcard is the first to generate, but for example you could choose the hundreth passcard to be the one you want to display first.
</p><br />
<p>Passcard size: is the size of the passcard when printed. The deafult size is 14 which is the size of a “credit card” when printed.
