    Make this image randomize with all the images from here, I really would like to build a fulls creen gallery page maybe, where the image has a right and a left button.
	under the main image there is a carrousel of more images. Then the Gallery section will be right under This gallery section.

        <h3>The most common RAM sizes for consumer PCs are <b>8GB</b> and <b>16GB</b>. These are sizes that typically
            are found in new
            computers, also 8 or 16 is
            sufficient for most tasks, such as web browsing, office work, media playback. And impressively the work gets
            done because of
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/ram-virtual-memory-pagefile-management"
                title="Virtual Ram">
                vr</a>, the only downside is the slower overall computer speed with memory intensive applications that
            require more memory.
        </h3>
        <h2>Some higher-end consumer PCs may come with 32GB, 64GB of RAM or more.</h2>
        <h3>In terms of configurations, consumer PCs typically use DDR4/5 memory, which is the most widely used type of
            RAM.
            Some older PCs may still use DDR3/2 memory, but this is becoming less common. Additionally, most consumer
            PCs use non-ECC
            <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ecc-memory-ram-glossary-definition,6013.html">(Error-Correction
                Code)</a>
            memory, which is less expensive and doesn't provide the same level of data protection as ECC memory.
            The actual speed of the RAM can vary depending on the specific
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">ICs</a> and the
            motherboard's memory controllers.
            Say a baseboard only supports upto a certain speed of memory.(eg. 4GB) even after adding more (+2GB) the
            computer
            might not recognize the extra ram.<br />[4+2=6, but the maximum allowed is 4, so even with 6gb of memory,
            the computer will only have a total of 4gb.]Also, the benefit of faster RAM speed depends on the usage,
            scenario,
            and the specific application; in most cases, applications and games may not be able to take full advantage
            of the faster memory,
            but if you are doing memory-intensive tasks such as video editing, 3D rendering, or running a lot of virtual
            machines, faster RAM can provide a
            significant performance boost. <b>Note that capacity is not the same as speed</b>

                The main difference between an SSD and a Hard Disk Drive (HDD - shown above); is that the SSD doesn't
                have any moving parts and because of it, it makes reading and writing data much faster than a mechanical
                HDD, which has spinning platters. The platters work alongside an actuator arm that has a slider, think
                of it like a record player from back in the day.

                capacity of 32GB, sequential read/write speeds of 57 MB/s and 32 MB/s respectively and a hefty price tag
                of around $1000.

                The most common HDD has an average speed of 80-160 Megabytes per second, read and write speeds.

                An HDD is essentially a metal platter with a magnetic coating that stores your data.<div
                    style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    A read/write head on an arm (or a set of them) accesses the data while the platters are spinning.
                </div>
                An SSD performs the same basic function as a HDD, but data is instead stored on interconnected
                flash-memory chips that retain the data even when there is no power flowing through them.
                These flash chips (often dubbed “NAND”) are of a different type than the kind used in USB thumb drives,
                and are typically faster and more reliable.
                <div style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    The key differences between HDDs and SSDs are that SSDs are faster, more reliable, and more
                    expensive than HDDs. HDDs are cheaper and have more storage space than SSDs.

                Once upon a time, magnetic storage was the only way to store data on computers. It was a revolutionary
                technology that allowed people to store large amounts of data in a small space. The first magnetic
                storage device was invented in 1956 by IBM and it was called the

            <h2>
                Magnetic storage devices were used for many years and they continued to improve over time.</h2>
            <p>Computer storage devices became smaller, faster, and more reliable. However, they had their limitations.
                They were prone to failure due to their mechanical nature and they were not very fast compared to other
                types of storage devices.
                Solid state drives (SSDs) were invented over half a century ago and then made widely commercially
                available. <br />They use non-volatile solid state chips that feature flash memory cells to store data
                on a long-term basis. Unlike traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), which use magnetic platters spinning
                at high speeds to using an actuator arm reminiscent of a record player, SSDs require no moving parts.
                <div style="text-indent: 25px;">
                    This makes them much faster at reading and writing data, both ad hoc and in sustained operations.
                    SSDs also have built-in technology that further improves read/write speeds, making them faster than
                    traditional HDDs.</div>
                SSDs are also more reliable than traditional HDDs (from a mechanical and data integrity standpoint).
                They do not require an additional power source that maintains an electrical current into the device at
                all times to preserve the data. This makes them increasingly more reliable than traditional HDDs.

                The cost of SSDs has come down significantly over the years as well. They are now much more affordable
                than they used to be. The storage sizes have also increased significantly over time. Today&apos;s SSDs
                can store up to several terabytes of data.

        <h2>How to Pick an SSD for your computer</h2>
        <p>Choosing the best SSD for your computer depends on several factors, including your specific requirements,
            budget, and compatibility with your system.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the best SSD for your system depends on an specific use case. For general productivity and
            gaming, a mid-range NVMe SSD with ample capacity is often a good choice. When more performance is required
            for intensive tasks like video editing or professional applications, it is worth it to consider a high-end
            NVMe SSDs.</p>
        <h2>Selecting, and, or upgrading to an SSD:</h2>
        <div>
            <strong class="ssd">Form Factor:</strong> SSDs come in various form factors, such as 2.5-inch, M.2, and U.2.
            Ensure that the SSD you choose is compatible with your computer's available slots and connections.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Interface:</strong> The most common interfaces for consumer SSDs are SATA
            (for 2.5-inch drives) and NVMe (for M.2 and U.2 drives). NVMe offers faster speeds than SATA, so if your
            computer supports NVMe, it's generally a better choice for better performance.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Capacity:</strong> Determine how much storage you need. SSDs are available
            in different capacities, ranging from 128GB to several terabytes. Consider your current and future storage
            needs before deciding.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Performance:</strong> Look at the SSD's read and write speeds. NVMe SSDs
            generally have faster speeds than SATA SSDs, resulting in quicker boot times and faster file transfers.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Endurance:</strong> Check the TBW (Total Bytes Written) or DWPD (Drive
            Writes Per Day) rating to understand the SSD's endurance and expected lifespan, especially if you plan on
            performing a lot of read/write operations.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Cache:</strong> Some SSDs have cache memory to improve performance. A larger
            cache can positively impact the SSD's speed.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Brand and Reliability:</strong> Stick to well-known and reputable brands
            that have a history of producing reliable SSDs.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Price:</strong> Compare prices from different manufacturers and retailers,
            considering your budget and the overall value you get from the SSD.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Warranty:</strong> Check the warranty period offered by the manufacturer. A
            longer warranty generally indicates the company's confidence in the SSD's reliability.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Compatibility:</strong> Ensure that the SSD is compatible with your
            computer's operating system and hardware. Check for driver support if required.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Read Reviews:</strong> Read user and expert reviews to gain insights into
            real-world performance and reliability.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Data Migration:</strong> If you're replacing your existing hard drive with
            an SSD, check if the manufacturer provides data migration software or consider using third-party tools to
            clone your data to the new SSD.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">TRIM Support:</strong> TRIM is a feature that helps maintain SSD performance
            over time. Ensure that your operating system and SSD support TRIM.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Overprovisioning:</strong> Some SSDs come with overprovisioning, which
            reserves a portion of the storage for background tasks to enhance performance and longevity.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Security:</strong> If data security is a concern, look for SSDs that offer
            hardware-based encryption and security features.
            <br /><br /><strong class="ssd">Data Migration:</strong> If you're replacing your existing hard drive with
            an SSD, check if the manufacturer provides data migration software or consider using third-party tools to

        <p>Desktop computers require a power supply unit (PSU) to convert AC power from the wall outlet into DC power
            that can be used by the computer&#39;s internal components. A desktop computer PSU typically ranges in power
            output from 300 to 1200 watts, with the most common wattages being between 400 and 800 watts. The wattage
            needed for a desktop computer PSU is determined by the power requirements of the internal components,
            including the CPU, GPU, hard drives, water pumps, radiators, fans and any additional hardware such as a
            sound card or optical drives.</p><img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/psu.jpg" class="fl">
        <p>When choosing a PSU for a desktop computer, it is important to ensure that it has the necessary wattage to
            power all of the components in the system, while also providing enough headroom for future upgrades. A PSU
            that is too weak for the system can cause stability issues or even damage to the hardware, while a PSU that
            is too powerful may waste energy and be more expensive than necessary.</p>
        <img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/psu2.png" class="rtl">
        <h2>PSUs are typically rated for efficiency using the 80 Plus<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus"
                title="80 Plus"> certification system</a>, which ranges from 80 Plus (basic efficiency) to 80 Plus
            Titanium (highest efficiency). A more efficient PSU will waste less energy as heat and will result in lower
            electricity bills over time.</h2>
    </article>
    <article class="fullbar article">
        <p><strong class="psu">Power Adapters for Laptops:</strong> Laptops, on the other hand, typically do not have an
            internal PSU. Instead, they use a power adapter (brick) that converts AC power from the wall outlet into DC
            power that can be used by the laptop. Laptop power adapters are typically rated for output voltage and
            amperage, and are designed to provide the specific voltage and amperage required by the laptop&#39;s
            internal components.</p>
        <img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/portablepower.png" class="rtl">
        <p>When choosing a power adapter for a laptop, it is important to ensure that it provides the correct voltage
            and amperage, as using an adapter with the wrong specifications can damage the laptop&#39;s internal
            components. It is also important to choose an adapter that is compatible with the laptop&#39;s charging
            port.</p><img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/slimpower.png" class="fl">
        <p>Laptop power adapters come in a variety of sizes and shapes, with some designed for travel and others for use
            at a desk. Some adapters also include additional features, such as the ability to charge multiple devices at
            once or the ability to adjust the output voltage to support a wider range of devices.</p>

        <p>Computer graphics has come a long way since its inception in the early 1950s. In the early days of computing,
            graphics were primarily used to create simple images and diagrams for scientific and engineering purposes.
            However, with the advent of gaming and multimedia, the demand for more sophisticated and realistic graphics grew
            exponentially.</p>
        <h2>Here are some of the milestones in the history of computer graphics, with a particular focus on the role of
            GPUs:</h2>
        <p>The first digital computer graphics were created in the 1950s using vector graphics systems that used <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube" title="cathode ray tubes">cathode ray tubes</a> to
            display simple line drawings.</p>
        <p>In the 1960s, <a href="<?= $links["IvanSutherland"][0] ?>" title="Ivan Sutherland">
                <?= $links["IvanSutherland"][1] ?></a> created Sketchpad, the first
            computer program that could draw images on a computer screen. Sketchpad laid the groundwork for modern computer
        graphics and user interfaces.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, computer graphics became more sophisticated with the introduction of the first 3D graphics
        software, such as the University of Utah&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot"
            title="University of Utah">Utah Teapot</a>&quot; program.</p>
    <p>The 1980s saw the introduction of the first personal computers with <a
            href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/g/gui.htm" title="GUI">graphical user interfaces (GUIs)</a> such
        as the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC. This helped to popularize computer graphics and bring it into the
        mainstream.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, the introduction of dedicated <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/650-history-of-the-gpu/"
            title="GPU">graphics processing units (GPUs)</a> allowed computers to render 3D graphics in real-time,
        enabling the development of 3D video games and other applications.</p>

                    Passive cooling systems use natural convection or airflow to remove heat from the computer.
                    Passive cooling systems are typically made up of heat sinks or radiators that absorb heat from the CPU
                    and other components and disperse it through a series of fins or pipes.',

                'passiveAndActiveActive'=>'active cooling uses a fan or pump to create
                    forced airflow or liquid circulation to remove heat from the computer. Active cooling is typically more
                    effective than passive cooling because it can move air or liquid at a higher velocity, thus removing
                    heat more efficiently.',

                'air'=>'Air-cooled systems',

                'common'=>'are the most common and use fans to blow air over the heat sink, which in turn dissipates heat from the CPU.',

                'liquid'=>'Liquid-cooled systems',

                'pump'=>', on the other hand, use a pump to circulate liquid through a radiator to remove heat from the CPU and other components.',

                'thermoelectric'=>'Thermoelectric coolers',

                'peltier'=>'use the Peltier effect to cool the CPU by creating a temperature differential between two surfaces.',

                'ssc'=>'there have been advancements in solid-state cooling technology, which uses materials that can transfer heat without the need for a fan or liquid. These materials are known as thermoelectric materials and can be used to create solid-state heat sinks or coolers that can be incorporated into a computer&#39;s cooling system.',

                'laserCooling'=>'This is a fascinating phenomenon in physics that involves the use of lasers to cool atoms or molecules down to extremely low temperatures, often close to absolute zero. It relies on the principles of quantum mechanics and involves manipulating the motion of particles through the absorption and emission of photons.',

                'dopplerCooling'=>'This method utilizes the Doppler effect to slow down the movement of atoms or molecules. Laser beams are directed at the particles, and as they absorb and re-emit photons, their momentum changes. By carefully tuning the frequency of the lasers, the particles can be slowed down significantly.',

                'sisyphus'=>'In this technique, particles are trapped in a periodic potential, often created by intersecting laser beams. As the particles move through this potential, they exchange kinetic energy with the light field, leading to further cooling.',

                'evaporative'=>'Once the particles are sufficiently cooled using techniques like Doppler and Sisyphus cooling, evaporative cooling can be employed to further reduce their temperature. This involves selectively removing the highest-energy particles from the system, leaving behind a colder ensemble.',

                'laserCoolingSummary'=>'In summary, computer coolers are essential to ensure that the CPU and other critical components of a computer are kept within safe operating temperatures. Active cooling systems, including air-cooled, liquid-cooled, and thermoelectric coolers, are more effective than passive cooling systems and can help extend the lifespan and improve the performance of a computer. Solid-state cooling technology is also an emerging technology that has the potential to improve computer cooling systems further.',

                'airCooling'=>'Air coolers are the most common type of CPU cooler. They consist of a heat-sink with metal fins and one or more fans mounted on top or alongside the fins.',

                'airCooling2'=>'The fan(s) blow air over the heat-sink, dissipating heat from the CPU. Heat pipes, often embedded in the heat-sink, help conduct heat away from the CPU to the fins where it can be dispersed.',

                'liquidCooling'=>'Liquid coolers, also known as water coolers, use a closed-loop system to transfer heat away from the CPU.',

                'liquidCooling2'=>'A pump circulates a coolant (usually water mixed with a coolant additive) through tubes connected to a radiator. The radiator dissipates heat into the surrounding air, and the cooled coolant is then pumped back to the CPU block to absorb more heat.',

                'solidStateCooling'=>'Solid-state coolers use thermoelectric materials to transfer heat without the need for fans or liquid.',

                'solidStateCooling2'=>'These materials create a temperature gradient when an electric current is applied, enabling heat transfer. Solid-state coolers are still emerging and hold potential for compact and efficient cooling solutions.',

                    'They typically feature a liquid cooling loop for the CPU with an integrated air cooler for other components such as VRMs (Voltage Regulator Modules) or RAM.'],

                'pcc'=>['Phase change cooling systems use refrigerants to cool the CPU.','The refrigerant undergoes phase changes from liquid to gas and back, absorbing heat during evaporation and releasing it during condensation. While highly effective, phase change cooling systems are expensive and complex, making them impractical for most users.'],

    <h2>Inception and Evolution of Computer Mouse Technology</h2>
    <h3>The computer mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1963, while he was working at the Stanford Research Institute. The original design of the mouse included two perpendicular wheels that could detect the direction of movement. Later, the design was improved to include a ball that rolled on two axes, detecting the direction of movement and transmitting this information to the computer.</h3>
    <h3>In the 1980s, the mouse became a popular peripheral for personal computers, particularly with the rise of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the introduction of the Apple Macintosh computer. Over time, the mouse has continued to evolve, with new designs and features that make it more ergonomic and easier to use.</h3>
    <h3>In the early 2000s, the mouse began to see competition from other input devices such as touchscreens, trackpads, and styluses. However, the mouse remains a popular and essential tool for many computer users, particularly for tasks that require precision and accuracy.</h3>

    <h2>Future of Computer Mouse Technology</h2>
    <h3>The future of computer mouse technology is likely to continue its evolution towards more ergonomic designs and more advanced features. Some current trends in mouse design include the use of wireless connectivity and improved sensors for greater accuracy.</h3>
    <h3>In addition, there is ongoing research into new input technologies that could eventually replace the mouse altogether. For example, there are prototypes for devices that use eye-tracking or brain-computer interfaces to control a computer. However, these technologies are still in the early stages of development and are not yet widely available.</h3>
    <h3>Overall, it is likely that the computer mouse will continue to be an important tool for computer users for the foreseeable future, even as new input technologies emerge.</h3>

    <ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;">
    	<li>	<h3>Gesture-based input: One possible future for input devices is the use of gestures, such as hand and finger movements, to control computer interfaces. This could be accomplished with cameras, sensors, or other technologies that can detect and interpret gestures in real-time. While this type of input is still in its early stages, it has the potential to provide more natural and intuitive interaction than traditional mouse and keyboard input.</h3>
    	</li>
    	<li>	<h3>Touchscreens: Touchscreens are already a popular input method for mobile devices and some laptops, and they could become more widespread in desktop computing as well. With the increasing availability of large, high-resolution touchscreens, users may be able to interact with their computers through touch gestures rather than a mouse.</h3>
    	</li>
    	<li>	<h3>Voice and AI-based interfaces: Another potential future for input devices is the use of voice commands and artificial intelligence (AI) to control computer interfaces. With the development of natural language processing and machine learning technologies, users may be able to interact with their computers through voice commands and have their requests interpreted and executed by AI assistants.</h3>
    	</li>
    	<li>	<h3>Augmented and virtual reality: As augmented and virtual reality technologies continue to develop, they may offer new ways of interacting with digital content beyond the traditional mouse and keyboard. For example, users may be able to use hand gestures or other movements to manipulate virtual objects in 3D space.</h3>

        Overview
    </h2>
    <h3>
        The mechanical typewriter invented by Christopher Latham Sholes in the late 1800s, was a revolutionary device that
        could imprint letters on paper with the touch of a key, replacing the laborious task of handwriting.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        However, the original QWERTY keyboard layout that Sholes came up with had some flaws. The keys were arranged in a
        way that made typing fast difficult, as the most commonly used letters were placed far apart. The result was that
        typists would often jam the keys, causing the typewriter to stop working.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        In the early 1900s, another inventor named August Dvorak decided to solve this problem by creating a new keyboard
        layout that would make typing more efficient. His design placed the most frequently used letters in the middle row
        and arranged the keys so that the fingers would move less, reducing fatigue and increasing speed. This layout became
        known as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard.</h3>
    <h3>
        Despite its benefits, the Dvorak keyboard didn&#39;t catch on immediately. The QWERTY keyboard had already become
        standard, and it was difficult to convince people to switch to a new system. However, some enthusiasts continued to
        promote the Dvorak keyboard, arguing that it was more comfortable and efficient.</h3>
    <h3>
        Today, electronic keyboards have replaced the old mechanical typewriters, and both QWERTY and Dvorak layouts are
        still in use. Some people even create their own custom keyboard layouts, using the latest technology to design
        keyboards that fit their individual needs.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        And so the story of the keyboard continues, evolving and adapting to the needs of each generation. Who knows what
        new innovations and designs we will see in the future?
    </h3>

        <h2>The Epic Journey of PCI:</h2>
        <h3>From Humble Beginnings to Modern Marvel</h3>
        <p> Once upon a time in the tech realm of the early 1990s, computer enthusiasts and engineers faced a conundrum.
            They yearned for a standardized way to connect various hardware components to their motherboards, a system
            that would transcend the limitations of the past. Enter the protagonist of our tale: the Peripheral
            Component Interconnect, better known as PCI. </p>
    </section>
    <br />
    <!--|--\(^-^)/--|-->
    <h2>Chapter 1: The Genesis</h2>
    <p> Born in 1992, PCI emerged as a revolutionary interface, poised to replace older and slower technologies like ISA
        (Industry Standard Architecture) and VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) Local Bus. The goal? To
        provide a versatile, high-speed channel for components like graphics cards, network cards, and storage devices
        to communicate with the motherboard and CPU. This was like opening a high-speed expressway within the computer,
        allowing data to flow like never before. </p>
    <h2>Chapter 2: The Growth Spurt - PCI-X</h2>
    <p> As technology galloped ahead, the demands of power users and enterprise environments escalated. The original
        PCI, though remarkable, couldn't keep up. Thus, the PCI-X (PCI eXtended) standard was born around the late
        1990s. With increased speeds and improved data transfer capabilities, it aimed to cater to the needs of servers
        and high-performance computing systems. Imagine a turbocharged version of PCI, built for the data-hungry demands
        of the era. </p>
    <h2>Chapter 3: The Revolution - PCIe (PCI Express)</h2>
    <p> Just when you thought the story couldn't get any juicier, along comes PCIe in the early 2000s, the crown jewel
        of the PCI family. PCI Express ditched the parallel communication method of its predecessors and embraced a
        high-speed, serial connection strategy. This allowed for even faster data transfer rates and better scalability.
        Plus, it eliminated the bottlenecks that often plagued parallel interfaces. It's like replacing a congested city
        road with a sleek, multi-lane highway system. </p>
    <h2>Why the Different Sizes and Speeds, You Ask?</h2>
    <section class="colms2">
        <strong style="padding-left: 25%; font-size: 1.2rem;">1. Form Factors:</strong>
        <br />
        <p tabindex="0" class="selection"> Computers come in all shapes and sizes, from slim laptops to gargantuan
            server racks. To accommodate this diversity, PCI Express slots come in different physical sizes or form
            factors, denoted by the number of lanes they support. The most common sizes are x1, x4, x8, and x16, with
            "x" representing the number of lanes. More lanes mean more data can flow simultaneously, like adding more
            lanes to a highway. </p>
        <strong style="padding-left: 25%; font-size: 1.2rem;">2. Speed Grades:</strong>
        <br />
        <p tabindex="0" class="selection"> Just as a car's speedometer measures velocity, PCIe slots are classified by
            their maximum data transfer rates, commonly referred to as "generations." The higher the generation, the
            faster the speed. PCIe 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 have successively upped the ante, enabling mind-boggling
            data transfer rates. Imagine upgrading your car's engine for more horsepower with each new generation. </p>
    </section>
    <h2>Epilogue: The Unending Saga of Evolution</h2>
    <p> PCI and its iterations have been a cornerstone of computer connectivity for decades. They've witnessed the rise
        of the internet, the explosion of digital media, and the proliferation of artificial intelligence. Today, PCIe
        4.0 and 5.0 are setting the stage for the future, with speeds that boggle the mind. As technology evolves, so
        will these interfaces, continuing to bridge the gap between our hardware dreams and the motherboard reality. And
        thus, the saga of PCI marches on, a testament to the relentless pursuit of progress in the ever-expanding
            universe of computing. </p>

            The concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tablet_computers">computer tablet</a> dates back to the mid-20th century, with early ideas of electronic devices
            resembling tablets emerging in science fiction. However, the practical development began in the 1960s.
            <a rel="example_group" href="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/tablets/dynabook.jpg" title="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mobile-computing/18/315"><img src="https://latinospc.com/images/hardware/hw/tablets/dynabook.webp" height="100px" width="40%" alt="Alan Kay's Dynabook" class="rtl"></a>
            One notable example is the "<a href="https://blogthinkbig.com/dynabook-2/">Dynabook</a>" concept proposed by
            computer scientist <a href="https://youtu.be/r36NNGzNvjo?si=Q0Knnb9ghDn5rRXI">Alan Kay</a> in 1968, envisioning a portable device similar to today's tablets. Yet, due to technological
            limitations, these early ideas remained largely conceptual.

            The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of early tablet-like devices, such as the <a href="https://oldcomputers.net/gridpad.html">GRiDPad</a> in 1989,
            which was used primarily in specialized industries.

            Microsoft also introduced the <a href="https://socket3.wordpress.com/2019/07/31/windows-for-pen-computing-1-0/">Windows for Pen Computing</a> platform in the early 1990s, which aimed to bring handwriting
            recognition and touch-based interaction to Windows-based devices. However, these early attempts were hampered by
            limited hardware capabilities, bulky designs, and underdeveloped software.

            responsive touchscreen, and a robust app ecosystem, revolutionized the concept of tablets.It quickly became a commercial success,
            inspiring other manufacturers to develop their own tablet devices. This marked a turning point in the tablet's history, leading to

            As for the future of computer tablets, there are many opinions and predictions.
            Some believe that Android tablets may be the future of computing⁵.
            Google is trying to bring its technology back into the limelight, starting with software like Entertainment Space and the Android 12L OS⁵.
            Android tablet usage is steadily growing and Android led the way with a 44.91 percent market share in 2020, mainly thanks to Samsung, which also grew in value by 18.2 percent⁵.
            The tablet market as a whole is expected to reach $50.31 billion by 2027⁵.

        <section class="centercenter">They are devices that create a virtual reality for the user, by blocking out the real world and replacing it with a digital environment.
        VR headsets usually have screens that cover the eyes, headphones that cover the ears, and sensors that track the user's head and body movements.
        Some VR headsets also have controllers that allow the user to interact with the virtual world.</section>

        <section class="centercenter2">Devices that augment the real world with digital information, by overlaying images, sounds, or texts on top of what the user sees.
        AR headsets usually have transparent lenses or glasses that let the user see through them, speakers or earbuds that let the user hear sounds, and cameras or sensors that track the user's eye and head movements.
        Some AR headsets also have microphones or touch-pads that allow the user to communicate with the digital information.</section>

    <fieldset><legend class="card2">VR headsets and AR headsets</legend>Currently they both have different applications and advantages.<br />
        <strong>VR</strong> headsets are ideal for immersive gaming, entertainment, education, and training, as they can transport the user to any place or time they want.<br />
        <strong>AR</strong> headsets are ideal for enhancing productivity, communication, navigation, and accessibility, as they can provide useful information or assistance to the user in any situation.
    <p class="big arvr" tabindex="0">
    They also both have different challenges and limitations.<br />
    <em>VR</em> headsets require a lot of processing power and battery life, as they have to render complex graphics and sounds in real time.<br />
    They also can cause motion sickness, eye strain, or disorientation for some users, as they disconnect them from their physical surroundings.<br />
    <em>AR</em> headsets require a lot of accuracy and stability, as they have to align the digital information with the real world.<br />
    They also can cause privacy, security, or ethical issues for some users, as they collect and display personal or sensitive data.

    To illustrate the differences between VR headsets and AR headsets, here's a poem I wrote: (Bing Chat - 8/23/2023)


    <pre class="colms2 poem">
    VR is like a dream
    That takes you far away
    To places you've never seen
    Or worlds you want to stay

    AR is like a friend
    That stays by your side
    To help you comprehend
    Or guide you when you're lost

    VR is like a magic
    That transforms your reality
    To fantasies you can pick
    Or stories you can be

    AR is like a tool
    That enhances your reality
    To facts you can use
    Or tasks you can do

    VR is like a wonder
    That fills you with awe
    To marvels you can discover
    Or mysteries you can solve

    AR is like a mirror
    That reflects your reality
    To insights you can learn
    Or feedback you can get

    VR is like an escape
    That frees you from your limits
    To adventures you can shape
    Or challenges you can face

    AR is like an extension
    That connects you to your world
    To people you can interact
    Or things you can control

        <p class="sub_title">The history of pencils is quite fascinating and spans several centuries.</p>
        <p class="sub_title">Pencils have played a crucial role in the world of writing and drawing, and their evolution has been marked by significant technological advancements and artistic contributions.</p>
        <p class="sub_title">Here's a brief overview of the history of pencils:</p>
        <section>
        <div class="blurb">
        <span>1. Ancient Beginnings:</span>
        <div class="colms">
        <p>The precursor to modern pencils can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Romans.</p>
        <p>They used a thin metal or lead stylus to etch marks onto papyrus or wax tablets.</p>
        <p>However, these early tools were not as versatile or practical as modern pencils.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>2. Discovery of Graphite:</span>
        <div class="colms2">
        <p>The breakthrough in pencil history came in the late 16th century when a large deposit of graphite,
            a naturally occurring form of carbon, was discovered in Borrowdale, England.</p>
        <p class="spacio">This graphite was initially used to mark sheep, but people soon realized its potential for writing due to its smooth and dark marks.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>3. Early Pencil Innovations:</span>
        <div class="colms">
        <p>In the 17th century, craftsmen began encasing graphite in various materials, such as string, leather, and paper.</p>
        <p>The first recognizable pencil was invented in the early 18th century when the German-Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner encased graphite sticks in a wooden holder.</p>
        <p>However, these early pencils were still quite crude and fragile.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>4. Harder Lead Pencils:</span>
        <div class="colms">
        <p>The English chemist Joseph Priestley further improved pencil technology in the late 18th century.</p>
        <p>He found that by mixing powdered graphite with clay, he could create a harder and more durable lead.</p>
        <p>This paved the way for the development of modern pencils.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>5. Industrial Revolution:</span>
        <div class="colms2">
        <p>The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century led to mass production of pencils.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="spacio">Innovations in manufacturing techniques, such as the use of machinery for cutting wood and molding graphite cores, made pencils more affordable and widely accessible.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>6. Erasers:</span>
        <div class="colms2">
        <p>In the early 19th century, a mistake-correcting innovation was introduced when an English
        engineer named Edward Nairne attached a piece of natural rubber to the end of a pencil.</p>
        <p class="spacio">This marked the birth of the eraser-tipped pencil, which quickly became popular.</p>
        <hr>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>7. Mechanical Pencils:</span>
        <div class="colms2">
        <p>The mid-19th century saw the invention of the mechanical pencil.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="spacio">These pencils featured a retractable lead mechanism, allowing writers and artists to extend the lead as it wore down, eliminating the need for constant sharpening.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>8. Graphite Grading Scale:</span>
        <div class="colms2">
        <p>In the early 20th century, the graphite grading scale was developed, categorizing pencils into different levels of hardness and darkness.</p>
        <p>This standardized system helped artists and writers choose the appropriate pencil for their needs.</p>
        </div></div>

        <div class="blurb">
        <span>9. Contemporary Pencils:</span>
        <div class="colms2">
        <p>Today's pencils come in a variety of designs, including traditional wooden pencils, mechanical pencils, and specialty pencils for specific artistic applications.</p>
        <p class="spacio">The core formula and manufacturing processes have been refined over time, resulting in high-quality, versatile writing and drawing tools.</p>
        </div></div>

            <legend>Ancient Writing Instruments:</legend>
            <p>Before the invention of pens, people used a variety of tools to write, including reeds, brushes, and quills made from feathers.</p>
            <p>These instruments were often dipped in ink and then used to create marks on surfaces like parchment or paper.</p>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Quill Pens:</legend>
            <p>Quill pens, made from the feathers of birds like geese or swans, were a significant development in writing technology.</p>
            <p>The hard shaft of the feather served as the nib, while the hollow structure helped hold and deliver ink.</p>
            <p>Quill pens gained popularity in the Middle Ages and were used for centuries by scholars, scribes, and writers.</p>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Steel Pens:</legend>
            <p>The early 19th century witnessed the rise of steel pens, which were sturdier and more durable than quills.</p>
            <p>The metal nibs were fitted into wooden or metal holders.</p>
            <p>These pens were particularly favored for their consistency in writing and were a precursor to modern fountain pens.</p>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Fountain Pens:</legend>
            <p>The fountain pen, as we know it today, started to take shape in the 19th century. The first practical fountain pen was patented by Petrache Poenaru in 1827. However, it was Lewis Waterman's invention in the late 1880s that successfully addressed issues of ink flow and leakage, making fountain pens more reliable and convenient.</p>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Ballpoint Pens:</legend>
            <p>The mid-20th century brought about a revolutionary change in writing technology with the invention of the ballpoint pen. László Bíró and his brother Georg patented the first commercially successful ballpoint pen design in 1938. These pens used a tiny ball in the tip that rotated and picked up ink from a reservoir, providing a smoother writing experience and avoiding ink spillage.</p>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Rollerball Pens:</legend>
            <p>A variation of the ballpoint pen, the rollerball pen, gained popularity in the 1970s. Rollerball pens used water-based ink that flowed more smoothly and offered a different writing experience compared to traditional ballpoint pens.</p>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Gel Pens:</legend>
            <p>Gel pens emerged in the 1980s, combining the characteristics of ballpoint and rollerball pens. They used gel-based ink that offered vibrant colors and a smooth writing feel.</p>
            </fieldset>

            <fieldset class="blurb">
            <legend>Modern Advancements:</legend>
