There is a problem with the Jesus Christ main page.
it works fine in English, but the Spanish version seems to not work as expected.
There is something missing, it might only need a separate code section only for the spanish version of the page.

I have a problem when loading Pages.

The first Problem I encountered was not being able to access the desired subdirectory such as:
hardware, services, security. I had to add an extra word with a underscore to make it work. (I do not know the reason as to why this happens.)
    The issue was that when I tried to access the desired URL I was met with a Content not found page, and not my 404 error page. (I think the code was working then it breaks, but renaming the URL works.)

Once the first issue was solved, I was a ble to move on, then a new issue arised. The CSS does not load propertly when I load data from a function, but If I access the data from a file, it works fine.

Eg. Services directory was loaded using single files, and it works fine.
    Security directory loads the content via functions, but the CSS does not work correctly in this situation.

Also the DevTools inside the browser show me that the <head> is empty, and is the <body> that one that contains the CSS.

I was able to solve the issue, by isolating the include file with in the subroute function, Once again Idk why this is a fix, but it is. 
I shall include the section tag in the subDirectory function, and the CSS will load correctly.
