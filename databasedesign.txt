There will be 2 tables.

pages & content

Pages looks like this:
ID |  name |

Content looks like this:
ID | Page ID | name | section | content |

The first table only needs 2 data entries.

The second table takes the name of the first one as it's Page ID.


The sections remain the same. look inside directory db for a full summary.



I need a better way to visualize the database for debugging, it looks a bit messy and hard to follow.
