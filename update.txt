    <WORKING (7/22/2025)>
    *Jesus Christ related content.* A $subroute has been added that splits the route into segments for subdirectory support, it will work for all pages.
        The issue is now: How to implement the content from each individual page. I was thinking that there could be 2 content classes one for English and one for Spanish.
            (The index already picks between 2 functions depending on the $lang.)
                a new method can be loaded instead of the current implementation, maybe content can load based on the given title?
                    ~This way is too rigid, but it should work for now~.
    (7/24/2025|Update) fullPageTemplate: I'm not sure if this is the best way to display the content functions,
        I really wanted to have some sort of method with a much more simple approach, and rely entirely on language or a title page.
    (7/24/2025|Update) content_HeavenlyFather.php: pages will have a Spanish version and an English one, the content will have the prefix _content
        All the _content pages must have a comment at the start of the file indicating which files are including it.
            I seriously need to consider a good method that will consolidate all 3 files into one.
                For now this temporary solution will become temporarily permanent.
    (7/25/2025|Update) There is a new class called Structure, which has the directory of the page, the language and the title.
        This is a simpler approach, I just need to go back to _JesusChrist dir and make one file containing the content for the one page.
            In this case is Father in Heaven tell me about the Web.

*Working Links and menus.*
*work on the services page.*
*work on the contact page.*
*work on the reviews page.*

*Work on a 404 page.*


*Done (7/21/2025)*
    <WORKING (7/19/2025)>
    *Next Step* Implement the front controller pattern. first implement the Spanish page.
        The directory location should be /español/ as the Spanish homepage, other location should be inside the root directory.
    {7/19/2025|Update} it seems that the site correctly indicates which page the user is on.
        My guess is to implement a simpler approach at "text" that repeats throughout the site such as the header and the footer.
            I would not want to use so many arrays, the structure is looking good, and in good form.
                I hope I can follow the implementation before the pasta turns into spaghetti.
                    enough of me, tell me about you! all the pages have 2 versions, English and Spanish.
    {7/21/2025|Update} Okay, so I've hit a roadblock...
        I won't be able to use that content() function to display different content for each page.
            The homepage is super dependent on it, so I gotta figure out a new way to do things.
*DONE (7/19/2025)* Finish the homepage. I like how Services has a small image. for now this homepage is nice!
* DONE (7/18/2025) <FIXED???>*Working (7/17/2025)*   In the Landing page, the subtitles should give a brief description before the user clicks on the link.
    I will mke use of the dialogEngine.js file, and add it to the workflow.
    This way there will be visual aid for future implementations.
~ Currently working on the implementation of teh text dialogs. I have added some css to mainStyle.css is still a work in progress,
    essentially that is how the standard text dialog will look like.
    there is a problem when the dialog is inside a grid item, this is css related, maybe because of the <p> tag. most likely the tag is causing problems. so far so good.
        <It looks like this implementation works. next step will be to test the image dialogs. >
*DONE (7/16/2025)*   I want to direct efforts towards the standardization of the content design.

- * Bread Crumbs ->->->-> I would like to have a nice breadcrumbs for every subindex page, say, for example SECURITY, inside the has backups and passwords, since we are in SECURITY, it would be a good idea to navigate to the root of this subdirectory. Users will be able to go elsewhere with the use of the main nav.
- * Sermons and Discourses ->->->-> need a better navigation, where it does not show the top of the page,  so this section can be more engaging, immersive and interactive.

I need to work on how the pages are structured, like when different tags are used, right now I feel it's a bit unclear because of the styles are called.
The way the css files are called at the moment is very complex, and confusing. I need a better way to add extra css files for the single pages that need them. I like seeing different styles across the site, but I also need a more organized structure that will lead to a better site design.
