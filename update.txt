    <WORKING (7/22/2025)>
    *Jesus Christ related content.* A $subroute has been added that splits the route into segments for subdirectory support, it will work for all pages.
        The issue is now: How to implement the content from each individual page.
            I was thinking that there could be 2 content classes one for English and one for Spanish.
                (The index already picks between 2 functions depending on the $lang.)
                    a new method can be loaded instead of the current implementation, maybe content can load based on the given title?
                        ~This way is too rigid, but it should work for now~.
    (7/24/2025|Update) fullPageTemplate: I'm not sure if this is the best way to display the content functions,
        I really wanted to have some sort of method with a much more simple approach, and rely entirely on language or a title page.
    (7/24/2025|Update) content_HeavenlyFather.php: pages will have a Spanish version and an English one, the content will have the prefix _content
        All the _content pages must have a comment at the start of the file indicating which files are including it.
            I seriously need to consider a good method that will consolidate all 3 files into one.
                For now, this temporary solution will become temporarily permanent.
    (7/25/2025|Update) There is a new class called Structure, which has the directory of the page, the language and the title.
        This is a simpler approach, I just need to go back to _JesusChrist dir and make one file containing the content for the one page.
            In this case is Father in Heaven tell me about the Web.
    (7/26/2025|Update) Tried making one file _JesusChrist, but I could not get it to work.
        I will stay with 3 files per location.
            The should be a total of 15 files when done with this Update.
    (7/28/2025|Update) Apostles Page is done. I need to fact check it further.
        Also I would love to add dialogs when the names are clicked.
    (7/29/2025|Update) Finally update from 7/24-7/26 was successful. merge all files into one file.
        All I had to do was to move the $page method over to the index where the URL was being selected.
    (7/30/2025|Update) trying to make parables work.
    (7/31/2025|Update) I am making progress with the parables page. I was able to get the template working. so I can move on from there.
        Essentially when the user clicks on the parable an image will appear, and the user can click on the fig caption link to download it.
            The end goal will be to make the image carrousel working so that when teh user navigates right or left the <figure> will update accordingly.
    (8/1/2025|Update) The parables template is completed, now I am seeing that the dialog is very narrow on mobile.
        I would like to make the dialog for the parables page wider, or compress the summary because there might be no space left for the user to tap off the dialog.
            The way the functions are being called I feel like is too redundant, but also I do not have the Spanish parables up and ready.
                I still need to check the gospel links since https://ebible.org/ is now being used.
                    Also I want to make 3 functions like the _Apostles page, where one is content, one parables and another parabolas.
                        The css will become part of the content function for now until the next CSS update.
    (8/2/2025|Update) The Dialog window is way better on mobile, also the content in the background does not scroll when the dialog is open.
        Parables have 3 functions just as required per the standard structural design of the site.
    (8/11/2025|Update) The Parables page is finally finished, all there is to do is to finish up the images, and do a quick audit to the functions.
        Also I would like to implement the Carousel, but I am guessing that will have to be done in a later update, for now it seems all is good.
    (8/12/2025|Update) Sermons Page has been integrated.
        Next step will be the translation of it.
    (8/14/2025|Update) The Sermons and Discourses page and the teachings page go side by side.
        Although the content is good, the way that is HTMLized is not the best.
            There will be more editions and revisions to these two pages.
    (8/23/2025|Update) There is a way to change the titles of the teachings page.
        Currently John is the only one displaying the correct title.
    (8/24/2025|Update) Breadcrumbs added, but they are a bit wordy, I would like to change them to some PHP code, but for now this is fine.
    (9/11/2025|Update)|*Work on getting the carousel to work, and implement it in parables, the current solution does not convince me.*
        There are some images in Teachings for Luke's section that a carousel would be wonderful for.|
            Finally the Carousel has been fixed. Template (fullPageTemplate.php) showcases how it works.
                Also the first implementation is on the Teachings Page for Luke's section. The three versions of each image are being used.
                    The fist displays the thumbnail version. The second the .WebP full size version, and the Third a link to the original .PNG file.
    (9/22/2025|Update) Although not part of the updates, the DB section is been updated.
        I am beginning to understand how to work the database.
            I am not sure how to call it better, but I am making new variables to understand the requests for data.
                This implementation I hope will not be too difficult, because teachings still needs to be translated.
                    I'm considering, making the page in the old fashion way, by creating 2d arrays and such.
    4/10/2025|Update) The Database implementation has been successful.
        The database is a two table implementation where one is the id of the pages in content.
            for example; I can call  page_id="home", or inicio, and it will give me the array for the same table where the contents were indexed differently.
                A new file SQLiteconnection.php shows how the database has indexed the data, and how to show it in the page as content.

*work on the reviews page.*
*work on a back-to-top button.*
*Work on a 404 page.*
*I would like to comeback to the Teachings page and modify the <ruby> tags where a dialog opens when clicked, but also there is an external link to teh verse in different versions of the Holy Scripture *



*Done (8/27/2025)*
    ||loading CSS files accordingly instead of using embedded CSS on each file.||
        The css will be in the same file as the content, but in a different function,
            I just had the realization that Loading CSS from within the content file would be better,
                than creating a whole new -short- file for each content page.
*Done (7/21/2025)*
    <WORKING (7/19/2025)>
    *Next Step* Implement the front controller pattern. first implement the Spanish page.
        The directory location should be /español/ as the Spanish homepage, other location should be inside the root directory.
    {7/19/2025|Update} it seems that the site correctly indicates which page the user is on.
        My guess is to implement a simpler approach at "text" that repeats throughout the site such as the header and the footer.
            I would not want to use so many arrays, the structure is looking good, and in good form.
                I hope I can follow the implementation before the pasta turns into spaghetti.
                    enough of me, tell me about you! all the pages have 2 versions, English and Spanish.
    {7/21/2025|Update} Okay, so I've hit a roadblock...
        I won't be able to use that content() function to display different content for each page.
            The homepage is super dependent on it, so I gotta figure out a new way to do things.
*DONE (7/19/2025)* Finish the homepage. I like how Services has a small image. for now this homepage is nice!
* DONE (7/18/2025) <FIXED???>*Working (7/17/2025)*   In the Landing page, the subtitles should give a brief description before the user clicks on the link.
    I will mke use of the dialogEngine.js file, and add it to the workflow.
    This way there will be visual aid for future implementations.
~ Currently working on the implementation of teh text dialogs. I have added some css to mainStyle.css is still a work in progress,
    essentially that is how the standard text dialog will look like.
    there is a problem when the dialog is inside a grid item, this is css related, maybe because of the <p> tag. most likely the tag is causing problems. so far so good.
        <It looks like this implementation works. next step will be to test the image dialogs. >
*DONE (7/16/2025)*   I want to direct efforts towards the standardization of the content design.

How does the site work? 7-29-2025
    The index.php is the entry point of the site.
        The method which decides where the user is gets called first.
            The each page needs 3 parameters: directory, language and title.

    The structure file is the actual HTML page.
        The header and footer are essential and are standard.
            The content of the site is inside the <main> tag.
                If the page matches the language and the title, then the page's content will be displayed.

    Finally each page content starts with a variable called $page.
        $page holds the directory level for the content, its language and title.
            Then there is a unique function that ideally has $variable arrays with the page's content.
                At the end of the function there is an include statement that loads the HTML for the content.
                    Lastly a final include statement loads the whole structure of the page.

- * Bread Crumbs ->->->-> I would like to have a nice breadcrumbs for every subindex page, say, for example SECURITY, inside the has backups and passwords, since we are in SECURITY, it would be a good idea to navigate to the root of this subdirectory. Users will be able to go elsewhere with the use of the main nav.
- * Sermons and Discourses ->->->-> need a better navigation, where it does not show the top of the page,  so this section can be more engaging, immersive and interactive.

 ―――PROBLEM ON TABLETS―――
 The dialog media queries are a bit odd, when the text dialog is too long it does not overflow.
    because of the rigid media query. This is a baby bug that only shows large mobile screens.

I need to work on how the pages are structured, like when different tags are used, right now I feel it's a bit unclear because of the styles are called.
The way the css files are called at the moment is very complex, and confusing. I need a better way to add extra css files for the single pages that need them. I like seeing different styles across the site, but I also need a more organized structure that will lead to a better site design.
